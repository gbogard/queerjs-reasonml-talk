# Type-safe, functional React with ReasonML

This is a talk on ReasonML I gave during a [QueerJS](https://queerjs.com/) online meetup.
It introduces some of Reason's most useful features, such as variants, pattern-matching, JSX support and JS 
interoperability using a React application as a demonstration.

## What is QueerJS?

[QueerJS](https://queerjs.com/) is a meetup for everyone where Queer Speakers take the stage. QueerJS meetups
are organized in several of the world's major cities, and they are safe places for **everyone**.

## What is ReasonML?

[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) is language and a tool chain built on the rock solid foundation of Ocaml. It is intended as a better,
type-safe way of building applications (web applications and otherwise) and is entirely interoperable with
the Javascript ecosystem.

It is probably the best way of developing React applications, among other things.

## What's in the repo?

This repository contains the pdf version and the markdown source of the slides, alongside the demo app, a partial
recreation of the QueerJS website.

You can try the app for yourself:

```
cd app
yarn
yarn start
```
